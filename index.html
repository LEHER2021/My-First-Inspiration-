       <div class="line"> </div>
       <p> .Super humans. We read about them, watch them and admire them in the virtual world - but I live with a superhuman. She is my mother . I am Leher Bohra, a 10-year-old student and activist from India. I am 84% differently abled, trying to break the stereotypes related to disabled people. My mother, Mrs Neha Bohra, is my role model. She inspires and motivates me to grow without any barriers. It seems to me that this woman looks at life as a challenge and wholeheartedly intends to seize the day every day .The experience of my life so far has truly brought things into perspective. My mother has taught me that hard times can be overcome and that losing battles can be won. She has taught me more than I could have learnt from any book. My mom taught me how to do fun activities .She sets an inspirational example to me teaching me how to live life and make wise choices, even in the most uncertain situations Mother is a supreme and divine creation of God, who loves and cares for her child unconditionally .There is a saying “Behind a successful man, there is a hand of a woman”; the woman is none other than our mother .My mother is a gift of God with motherhood and affection towards her child .My mother is the one I can completely depend on and trust .I respect my mother and also help her in her household activities .I also give a gift to her on occasion of ‘Mother’s Day’ as a tribute to her hard work and care. She is the one who gets worried whenever I fall ill and spends sleepless nights sitting beside me . Her inspirational stories had always played an important role in shaping my life . She is the one who faces all the problems bravely and does not let us encounter those . She always wants to see me as successful and nobleman and guides me to be on a righteous path .I respect her a lot. She is my inspiration, my role model . My mother is the sweetest and most important person in my life. She works as an Account Manager in a textile firm. Though she is a working woman, she also takes care of her family efficiently .She is very good at time management and gives equal time to professional and personal life. She wakes up early morning, prepares breakfast, sends us school before leaving for office. My mother is a hard-working woman who puts extra efforts for our secured future She showers equal love on me and my sister. My sister and I also help her in household chores when we are at home. We celebrate her birthday every year and give us gifts as a token of love towards her. My mother is the idol of my life, my inspiration and a person whom I respect the most after God. My Mother is my best friend with whom I share all my secrets and can talk freely on any matter. She is a great person who cares about me, thinks about me and wants to protect me from all problems. She is the one who is always concerned about my health and food. She is an important link of the family which connects all the family members .She takes care of all the members of the family, and she knows the needs and wants of every member very well. She sacrifices all her needs, wishes and desires to fulfil her child’s needs. Her love towards me as a child is always unconditional, and she takes proper care of me always. She provides a safe and secure environment so that her child could grow up without stress and risks .She is always concerned about my studies and academics; she helps in my homework and teaches me in the evening. When we come late than expected, her eyes always peep out of the door during the time of waiting .My mother has been the greatest influence in my life. She taught me how to be independent, how to make strong family connections, and how to set goals to become a strong woman. Through positive and negative times growing up, I have used every experience as a life lesson, and something to grow from. Your mom may get motivated if she saw people appreciating her work. Introduce her further to Pinterest where she can post photos of her work and people could follow her. If she gets a critical number of followers, she'd see it as a responsibility that she has to keep working and sharing her work. Hope this helps.
